# INTELLIGENT CAREER GUIDANCE SYSTEM

This is a web-based application developed to provide intelligent and personalized career recommendations to students and job seekers. It analyzes user input such as academic performance, interests, and optionally personality traits to suggest the most suitable career paths using rule-based and AI techniques.

About the Project
The Intelligent Career Guidance System is designed to help users make well-informed career choices. The system collects input from the user (such as academic details, interests, and optional personality test results) and provides career suggestions using logic-based algorithms or machine learning techniques.

It aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry demand by suggesting relevant job roles, higher education options, or skill development paths.
